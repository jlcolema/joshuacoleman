		<p>I'm an <b>independent inclusive design engineer, author, speaker, and trainer</b> based in Lebanon. I love the web platform and I want to make it better for everyone. And I consider myself to be completely blessed that I get to build it for a living.</p>

		<p>I have a Bachelor's Degreee is Computer Sciences, and have been doing what I do since 2013, when I started my freelance career, as well as published my first ever blog post on this site!</p>

		<p>I work with companies and agencies around the world, building web user interfaces, design systems, and digital products with focus on responsive design, accessibility, performance, and cutting-edge tech. I've worked with teams at companies like <b>SuperFriendly</b>, <b>Herman Miller</b>, <b>Khan Academy</b>, <b>Bosch</b>, and more.</p>

		<p>I also speak and run workshops across the globe, covering practical insights and tried and true practices for building scalable, resilient front-end foundations. Since 2014, I've presented and delivered Keynotes at dozens of events worldwide, and have led workshops at conferences, as well as in-house for companies like <b>Netflix</b>, <b>Telus</b>, and the <b>Royal Schiphol Group at Amsterdam Airport</b>.</p>

		<p>I wrote the <a href="https://www.example.com/">Codrops CSS Reference</a>, and co-authored the <a href="https://www.example.com/">Smashing Book 5</a> â€” a book that covers time-saving, practical techniques for crafting fast, maintainable and scalable responsive websites.</p>
