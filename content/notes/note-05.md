I'm an **independent, inclusive, design engineer, author, speaker, and trainer** based in Lebanon. I love the web platform and I want to make it better for everyone. And I consider myself to be completely blessed that I get to build it for a living.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Sciences, and have been doing what I do since 2013, when I started my freelance career, as well as published my first ever blog post on this site!
